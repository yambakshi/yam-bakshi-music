      lyrics: `Grains of sand slip out of your hand
It seems that you've got no other options
Lucid dreams or nightmares
Coexist with yourself, return to the path
A fraction of a second
Right before you take the shot

Look to me

But instead, youâ€™re probably dead
Do exactly as instructed
And if it should happen
Coexist with yourself
You were so close

Close to me`
